<p>Great, more thoughts on this below.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Andy. Good questions!</p>
<p>The intent was an outdoor network with point to point and omni
directional or multi directional down tilt antennas. Though I
suppose indoor expandability would be a future consideration. So
the focus would be outdoor at this time, with indoor later on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great - there are lots of options for equipment with that. Generally,
for outdoor service you want more centrally located omnidirectional
equipment, but you can also use wall-mounted omni or directional
access points for coverage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to have the option of buying antennas or experimenting
with my own. For point to point it seems easier, cheaper, and
better to just purchase a small dish. I would like to use an omni
or patch on one connector with a dish on the other (any thoughts?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building antennas can be a lot of fun, but can also be pretty fiddly -
there are lots of resources, especially from amateur (Ham) radio
operators. Search for resources on biquad and amos/quados antennas,
such as:
http://www.qsl.net/yu1aw/ANT_VHF/Amos_Ant/amos_antennas.htm
http://www.scribd.com/doc/121631287/AMOS-Antenna-With-Semicircular-Radiation-Diagram-For-2-4-GHz</p>
<p>I also wrote a blog post about AlterMundi&rsquo;s work using 2x2 MIMO
equipment to provide a directional signal, coupled with an omni signal
out of a single router:
https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2014/11/05/do-it-yourself-antennas-for-community-networks/
There original documentation is here, and is great:
http://docs.altermundi.net/RedesMiniMaxi/MontajeDeUnNodo</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The initial intent of the network will be multipurpose, but my
thoughts are this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>redundant point to point connection between campus locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wireless community backup communications network for emergency
situations, community based information for a decentralized
internet style network. Similar to the Red Hook project and
others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than that, it would serve as an experimental platform for
leaning and local communication for those who are in range and
wish to cooperate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds good - wireless is a great platform for those things. Think
about how / where you can provide wired connections as well - either
Ethernet or fiber - the performance and reliability can&rsquo;t be beat!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I understand the basic limitations of wireless communications such
as channel capacity and interference, but I would really like to
see this system implemented on a large scale.   If only we had
larger frequency bands to work with. I would really like to see a
community supported mesh with backhauls which approach the scale of
the cellular network. Maybe that&rsquo;s going way to far, but that&rsquo;s my
dream! I really like the idea of the ubiquiti air fiber for long
distance backhauls. Gotta start somewhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend using 5GHz for backhaul and point-to-point in this
day and age - 2.4GHz is pretty crowded. It can be used for small mesh
networks and Access Points, but you can definitely take 5GHz backhauls
to a large scale - the very big Wireless Internet Service Providers
(WISPs) use it pretty extensively.</p>
<p>Point-to-point links provide great performance, and can bridge
different types of networks at each end (point-to-multipoint or mesh).
For this, I would look at something like the Ubiquiti NanoBeam series:
https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/nanobeam-ac/
The lower-gain (shorter range) models are fairly affordable:
http://streakwave.com/Itemdesc.asp?ic=NBE-M5-16-US&amp;o1=0</p>
<p>For Do-It-Yourself point-to-point links, the AlterMundi method works,
and you could use two dishes to provide the full MIMO capacity through
(just orient the antennas in front of the dishes at 90 degrees from
each other - i.e. one vertically polarized and the other horizontally
polarized). The TP-Link routers work well for this - the WDR3600 would
be my first choice, as it is fairly affordable ($50 or so). You can
also re-flash the firmware to use just about anything else - Commotion
/ LibreMesh / qMp or whatever else for meshing.</p>
<p>For omni-directional mesh routers, I recommend the Rocket M2 or M5
(depending on which band you want to use), or TP-Link WDR3600 (or
WDR4300) routers. For the TP-Links, you will need to find an outdoor
enclosure to weatherproof them. The antenna you use can be anything
you want - the high-performance Ubiquiti AirMax omnis:
https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/airmax-omni-antenna/
More reasonably priced but shorter range omnis:
http://streakwave.com/itemdesc.asp?ic=OARDSBX244&amp;eq=&amp;Tp=&amp;o1=0
http://streakwave.com/itemdesc.asp?ic=OARDSBX55&amp;eq=&amp;Tp=&amp;o1=0
(Note, with these you don&rsquo;t gain the benefits of dual-polarity, but
there will still be a 2x2 MIMO signal)</p>
<p>Streakwave and other distributors have just about every type of
antenna you could dream of, but you can also play with making your own!</p>
<p>For directional mesh routers, you can&rsquo;t beat the Ubiquiti NanoStation
M2 or M5, or the TP-Link routers with custom antennas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks, Jared</p>

<p>Sure thing - I recommend going through some of our group activities
that are focused on wireless planning as well, to think and work out
router type and placement:
